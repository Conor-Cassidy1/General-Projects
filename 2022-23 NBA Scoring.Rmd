## Offensive Excellence...
This is just a short investigation into the scoring in the 2022/23 NBA season so far. It comes after a conversation with a friend in which we were discussing how the numbers that some players have been putting up recentely are ridiculous (e.g. D. Mitchell 71 point career high, L. Doncic's 60/20/10 game, Giannis w/ a career high etc.) and it made me question this offensive explosion... 

# Data 
?

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)


```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
